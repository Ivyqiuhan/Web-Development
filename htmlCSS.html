 	<p>Roussin said 47 of the new cases are linked to what he called "communal living communities" across Manitoba, some of which include Hutterite colonies.

"These testing campaigns are indicative of the fact that these communities are being co-operative and working with public health to try to limit the spread of the virus," he said.

In previous weeks, Hutterites reported increased stigmatization, and Roussin warned against that on Sunday.

"We know that stigmatizing certain groups impairs our ability to address this virus, so please be kind, listen to credible information and do whatever we can to avoid stigmatizing groups of people," he said.</p>
